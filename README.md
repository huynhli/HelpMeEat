# Help Me Eat

I don't normally eat out, but if I do, it's with friends. This usually ends up with everyone saying, "I don't know, you pick."  
This web app is meant to fix that. I hope it helps you too.

If you want to collab on this project or anything, [shoot me a message](mailto:liamtamh@gmail.com)! I'm always building projects and happy to join another.
